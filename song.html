What if I'd never run into you?
What if you'd never smiled at me?
What if I hadn't noticed you too?
And you'd never showed up where I happened to be
<br>What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
On a quiet night, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
I could have just walked by, who would've thought?
<br>What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
What are the chances?
<br>What if I hadn't asked for your name?
And time hadn't stopped when you said it to me?
Of all of the plans that I could've made
Of all of the nights that I couldn't sleep
<br>What's a girl like you doing in a place like this?
In a crowded room, what are the odds?
What's a guy like me doing in a place like this?
Getting close to you, but here we are
<br>What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Like two in a million, like once in a life
I could have found you, put my arms around you
Like two in a million, like once in a life
<br>What are the chances?
Is it love? Is it fate?
Who am I? Who's to say?
Don't know exactly what it means
<br>Is it love? Is it fate?
Where it leads, who can say?
Maybe you and I were meant to be
What are the chances that we'd end up dancing?
Two in a million, once in a life
That I could have found you
Put my arms around you (my arms around you)
<br>Two in a million, like once in a life, yeah
What are the chances?
Two in a million, once in a life
What are the chances?
Two in a million, once in a life
What if I'd never run into you?
And what if you'd never smiled at me?
